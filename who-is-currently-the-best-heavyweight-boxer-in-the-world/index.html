It is a sport that requires strength, agility, and a lot of hard work. Boxing fans around the world are always curious to know who the best heavyweight boxer is. In this article, we will explore who is currently the best heavyweight boxer in the world and why.</p><p>Many boxing fans believe that the heavyweight division is the most exciting division in the sport. The heavyweight boxers are the biggest and strongest fighters, and they always put on a good show. However, the heavyweight division has not always been as competitive as it is today. In recent years, the division has seen an increase in talent, which has made it more exciting for fans.</p><p>The current best heavyweight boxer in the world is Anthony Joshua. He is a British boxer who holds the WBA, IBF, and WBO titles. Joshua is a talented fighter who has been dominating the heavyweight division for the past few years. He has a record of 24 wins and one loss, with 22 of those wins coming by knockout.</p><p>In summary, Anthony Joshua is currently the best heavyweight boxer in the world. He has dominated the division for the past few years and holds three major titles. His record speaks for itself, with 22 of his 24 wins coming by knockout. Now, let's dive deeper into why he is considered the best heavyweight boxer in the world.</p><p><h2>Anthony Joshua's Fighting Style</h2></p><p>Anthony Joshua is a boxer who has an aggressive and powerful fighting style. He is known for his devastating knockout power, which has made him a fan favorite. Joshua has a good jab, which he uses to set up his power punches. He also has good footwork, which helps him move around the ring and avoid his opponent's punches.</p><p>I remember watching one of Joshua's fights where he knocked out his opponent in the second round. It was amazing to see how he used his jab to set up his power punches. His opponent couldn't keep up with Joshua's speed and power, and he was knocked out cold.</p><p><h2>Joshua's Rise to Fame</h2></p><p>Anthony Joshua's rise to fame has been impressive. He won a gold medal at the 2012 Olympics in London, which helped him gain recognition in the boxing world. He turned pro in 2013 and quickly started making a name for himself. In 2016, he won the IBF heavyweight title by defeating Charles Martin. Since then, he has been dominating the division and has become one of the most popular boxers in the world.</p><p>I remember watching Joshua's fight against Wladimir Klitschko in 2017. It was one of the most exciting fights I have ever seen. Joshua knocked Klitschko down in the fifth round, but Klitschko came back and knocked Joshua down in the sixth round. In the end, Joshua won the fight by knockout in the eleventh round. It was an amazing fight and showed how talented Joshua is.</p><p><h3>Anthony Joshua's Competition</h3></p><p>Although Anthony Joshua is currently the best heavyweight boxer in the world, he has some tough competition. One of his biggest rivals is Tyson Fury, who holds the WBC heavyweight title. Fury is known for his unorthodox fighting style and his ability to take a punch. If Joshua and Fury were to fight, it would be one of the biggest fights in boxing history.</p><p>Another boxer who could give Joshua a run for his money is Deontay Wilder. Wilder is known for his knockout power and has a record of 42 wins and one loss. He held the WBC heavyweight title for five years before losing it to Fury in 2020.</p><p><h4>How to Watch Anthony Joshua's Fights</h4></p><p>If you want to watch Anthony Joshua's fights, you can do so on various streaming platforms. DAZN is a popular streaming service that broadcasts boxing matches, including Joshua's fights. You can also watch his fights on Sky Sports, which is a UK-based sports channel.</p><p>Watching Joshua's fights is always exciting, and I can't wait to see who he fights next. He is the current best heavyweight boxer in the world, but he has some tough competition. Only time will tell if he can maintain his dominance in the division.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Who is currently the best heavyweight boxer in the world?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Anthony Joshua is currently the best heavyweight boxer in the world.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How many titles does Anthony Joshua hold?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Anthony Joshua holds three major titles â€“ the WBA, IBF, and WBO titles.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What is Anthony Joshua's fighting style?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Anthony Joshua has an aggressive and powerful fighting style.
