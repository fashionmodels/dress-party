Without insurance, you could be responsible for paying out of pocket for damages to your own vehicle, as well as any other vehicles or property involved in the accident. Additionally, if you cause injury to another person, you could be held liable for their medical expenses and lost wages. Car insurance provides peace of mind and financial protection in case the worst should happen.</p><p>Now that we understand the importance of car insurance, let's take a look at the most popular car insurance companies in Canada and what sets them apart.</p><p><h2>Intact Insurance</h2></p><p>Intact Insurance is the largest provider of property and casualty insurance in Canada, and they offer a variety of car insurance options to suit different needs and budgets.
