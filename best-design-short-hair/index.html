<meta name="description" content="10 Modern Bob Haircuts for WellGroomed Women Short Hairstyles 2020Have you ever struggled with finding the perfect hairstyle for your short hair? Do you feel like you&#39;re always settling for a basic cut instead of something that really stands out? Look no further! In this tutorial, we will cover the best design short hair options and how to achieve them.Short hair can be limiting when it comes to styling, but with the right techniques and products, it can be just as versatile as long hair. The biggest pain point for those with short hair is often feeling like there aren&#39;t many options beyond a basic bob or pixie cut. However, there are numerous ways to add texture, volume, and interest to short hair.The target of this tutorial is to provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to achieve the best design short hair looks. We will cover a variety of styles, from edgy to elegant, and provide tips on how to customize each look to suit your individual personality and features.In summary, this tutorial will cover the best design short hair options, how to achieve them, and tips for customization. We will address common pain points related to styling short hair and provide solutions for achieving the perfect look.The Classic Pixie CutOne of the most popular short haircuts is the classic pixie cut. This timeless style is both chic and low maintenance, making it a great choice for those who want to keep things simple. To achieve this look, start by asking your stylist to cut your hair short on the sides and back, leaving a longer section on top. The top section can be styled in a variety of ways, from slicked back to tousled.Personally, I have had a pixie cut for years and have found that adding a bit of texture spray to the top section adds volume and creates a more modern look. For a more edgy version of the pixie cut, ask your stylist to shave the sides and back for a bold statement.The Faux HawkIf you&#39;re looking for a more daring short hair option, the faux hawk might be just what you need. This edgy style is achieved by shaving the sides and back of the head and leaving a strip of hair on top. The strip of hair can be styled in a variety of ways, from a messy, textured look to a sleek, slicked-back style.I personally love this style because it adds a bit of edge to my look without being too extreme. To achieve the perfect faux hawk, I use a strong hold pomade and a texturizing spray to create volume and hold.Adding Color to Your Short HairAdding color to your short hair can take your look to the next level. Whether you choose a subtle highlight or a bold statement color, there are numerous ways to customize your short hair with color. One of the most popular techniques for short hair is balayage, which involves hand-painting highlights onto the hair for a natural, sun-kissed look.If you&#39;re feeling bold, consider a bright, playful color like pink or blue. Keep in mind that these colors will require more maintenance and touch-ups to keep them looking fresh.How to Style Your Short HairStyling short hair can seem daunting, but with the right products and techniques, it can be a breeze. One of the most important things to keep in mind when styling short hair is to use products that add texture and volume. Texturizing sprays, pomades, and volumizing mousses are all great options for achieving the perfect short hair look.When it comes to styling, I find that using a small amount of product and working in small sections helps to create a more polished look. For a messy, tousled look, use your fingers to scrunch and tousle your hair after applying product.Question and AnswerQ: Can I still curl my short hair?A: Absolutely! Use a small barrel curling iron or wand to create soft, bouncy curls in your short hair.Q: How often should I get my short hair cut?A: Short hair tends to grow out faster than long hair, so it&#39;s important to get regular trims every 4-6 weeks to maintain the shape and style.Q: Can I still wear hair accessories with short hair?A: Yes, there are numerous hair accessories that work well with short hair, from headbands to barrettes.Q: How do I keep my short hair looking fresh between washes?A: Dry shampoo is a great option for keeping short hair looking fresh between washes. Apply a small amount to the roots and use your fingers to massage it in.Conclusion of Best Design Short HairShort hair can be just as versatile and stylish as long hair with the right techniques and products. By trying out different styles and adding in some color or accessories, you can create a personalized short hair look that is both chic and unique. Remember to use products that add texture and volume, get regular trims, and have fun experimenting with your short hair!.">

Do you feel like you're always settling for a basic cut instead of something that really stands out? Look no further! In this tutorial, we will cover the best design short hair options and how to achieve them.</p><p>Short hair can be limiting when it comes to styling, but with the right techniques and products, it can be just as versatile as long hair. The biggest pain point for those with short hair is often feeling like there aren't many options beyond a basic bob or pixie cut. However, there are numerous ways to add texture, volume, and interest to short hair.</p><p>The target of this tutorial is to provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to achieve the best design short hair looks. We will cover a variety of styles, from edgy to elegant, and provide tips on how to customize each look to suit your individual personality and features.</p><p>In summary, this tutorial will cover the best design short hair options, how to achieve them, and tips for customization. We will address common pain points related to styling short hair and provide solutions for achieving the perfect look.</p><p><h2>The Classic Pixie Cut</h2></p><p>One of the most popular short haircuts is the classic pixie cut. This timeless style is both chic and low maintenance, making it a great choice for those who want to keep things simple. To achieve this look, start by asking your stylist to cut your hair short on the sides and back, leaving a longer section on top. The top section can be styled in a variety of ways, from slicked back to tousled.</p><p>Personally, I have had a pixie cut for years and have found that adding a bit of texture spray to the top section adds volume and creates a more modern look. For a more edgy version of the pixie cut, ask your stylist to shave the sides and back for a bold statement.</p><p><h2>The Faux Hawk</h2></p><p>If you're looking for a more daring short hair option, the faux hawk might be just what you need. This edgy style is achieved by shaving the sides and back of the head and leaving a strip of hair on top. The strip of hair can be styled in a variety of ways, from a messy, textured look to a sleek, slicked-back style.</p><p>I personally love this style because it adds a bit of edge to my look without being too extreme. To achieve the perfect faux hawk, I use a strong hold pomade and a texturizing spray to create volume and hold.</p><p><h3>Adding Color to Your Short Hair</h3></p><p>Adding color to your short hair can take your look to the next level. Whether you choose a subtle highlight or a bold statement color, there are numerous ways to customize your short hair with color. One of the most popular techniques for short hair is balayage, which involves hand-painting highlights onto the hair for a natural, sun-kissed look.</p><p>If you're feeling bold, consider a bright, playful color like pink or blue. Keep in mind that these colors will require more maintenance and touch-ups to keep them looking fresh.</p><p><h4>How to Style Your Short Hair</h4></p><p>Styling short hair can seem daunting, but with the right products and techniques, it can be a breeze. One of the most important things to keep in mind when styling short hair is to use products that add texture and volume. Texturizing sprays, pomades, and volumizing mousses are all great options for achieving the perfect short hair look.</p><p>When it comes to styling, I find that using a small amount of product and working in small sections helps to create a more polished look. For a messy, tousled look, use your fingers to scrunch and tousle your hair after applying product.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I still curl my short hair?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely! Use a small barrel curling iron or wand to create soft, bouncy curls in your short hair.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How often should I get my short hair cut?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Short hair tends to grow out faster than long hair, so it's important to get regular trims every 4-6 weeks to maintain the shape and style.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I still wear hair accessories with short hair?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, there are numerous hair accessories that work well with short hair, from headbands to barrettes.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I keep my short hair looking fresh between washes?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Dry shampoo is a great option for keeping short hair looking fresh between washes. Apply a small amount to the roots and use your fingers to massage it in.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Best Design Short Hair</h2></p><p>Short hair can be just as versatile and stylish as long hair with the right techniques and products. By trying out different styles and adding in some color or accessories, you can create a personalized short hair look that is both chic and unique. Remember to use products that add texture and volume, get regular trims, and have fun experimenting with your short hair!</p></article>
