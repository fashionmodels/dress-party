In this post, we will guide you through the best men's sunglasses brands in the UK, so you can make an informed decision.</p><p>When it comes to sunglasses, there are a few pain points that many men face. Some people struggle to find a pair that fits their face shape or matches their personal style. Others may have sensitive eyes and require polarized lenses. Additionally, some people may be on a budget and need to find an affordable option without sacrificing quality.</p><p>If you're looking for the best men's sunglasses brands in the UK, you've come to the right place. Our guide will help you find the perfect pair of shades for your needs and preferences.</p><p>In summary, this post will cover the best men's sunglasses brands in the UK, including their unique features, pricing, and style options. We will also provide tips on how to choose the right sunglasses for your face shape and lifestyle.</p><p><h2>Ray-Ban</h2></p><p>When it comes to iconic sunglasses, Ray-Ban is a top pick. This brand has been around for over 80 years and is known for its classic styles, such as the Wayfarer and Aviator. Ray-Ban sunglasses are made with high-quality materials and offer excellent UV protection. They are also available in a range of colours and lens types, including polarized and mirrored options. While Ray-Ban sunglasses can be pricey, they are a worthwhile investment for those who want a timeless and durable pair of shades.</p><p>Personally, I've owned a pair of Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses for several years and they are still in excellent condition. The classic design goes with any outfit and the polarized lenses make a huge difference in reducing glare and eye strain.</p><p><h2>Oakley</h2></p><p>For those who lead an active lifestyle, Oakley sunglasses are an excellent choice. This brand is known for its sporty designs and innovative technology, such as Prizm lenses that enhance colour contrast and clarity. Oakley sunglasses are also made with durable materials that can withstand a lot of wear and tear. While Oakley sunglasses can be on the pricier side, they are worth the investment for those who need a pair of shades that can keep up with their active lifestyle.</p><p>I recently purchased a pair of Oakley Holbrook sunglasses and have been impressed with their performance.

This brand offers polarized lenses at an affordable price point, making it easy for anyone to protect their eyes from harmful UV rays. Polaroid sunglasses are also available in a range of styles, from classic to trendy, so there's something for everyone.</p><p>While I haven't personally tried Polaroid sunglasses, many people rave about their affordability and quality. They are a great option for those who want to protect their eyes without breaking the bank.</p><p><h4>Tom Ford</h4></p><p>For those who want to make a statement with their sunglasses, Tom Ford is a top pick. This luxury brand offers stylish and unique designs that are sure to turn heads. Tom Ford sunglasses are also made with high-quality materials and offer excellent UV protection. While they are more expensive than other brands on this list, they are worth the investment for those who want to stand out.</p><p>I've always been a fan of Tom Ford sunglasses and recently purchased a pair of their Henry sunglasses. The bold design adds a touch of sophistication to any outfit and the lenses offer great clarity and protection.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q: How do I choose the right sunglasses for my face shape?</strong></p><p>A: The best way to choose sunglasses for your face shape is to identify your face shape and then select frames that complement your features. For example, those with a round face should choose square or rectangular frames to balance out their features. Those with a square face should choose round or oval frames to soften their features.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I wear sunglasses with prescription lenses?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, many sunglasses brands offer prescription lenses. You can either purchase sunglasses with prescription lenses already installed or have your own lenses fitted into a pair of frames.</p><p><strong>Q: What is the difference between polarized and non-polarized lenses?</strong></p><p>A: Polarized lenses are designed to reduce glare and improve visual clarity, making them ideal for activities such as driving or outdoor sports. Non-polarized lenses do not have this feature, but can still provide UV protection.</p><p><strong>Q: How much should I expect to spend on a pair of sunglasses?</strong></p><p>A: The cost of sunglasses can vary greatly depending on the brand, style, and features. You can find affordable options for under £20, while high-end brands can cost upwards of £200 or more.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Best Men's Sunglasses Brands UK</h2></p><p>When it comes to finding the right pair of sunglasses, it's important to consider your face shape, lifestyle, and personal style.
