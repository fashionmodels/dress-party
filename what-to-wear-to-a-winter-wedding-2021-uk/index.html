You want to look your best, but also need to stay warm and comfortable throughout the day. Not to mention, you don't want to be under or overdressed compared to the other guests. </p><p>When it comes to dressing for a winter wedding, it's all about layering and choosing the right fabrics.

It's also important to choose appropriate footwear such as boots or closed-toe heels to keep your feet warm and dry. </p><p>In summary, when deciding what to wear to a winter wedding 2021 UK, keep in mind the following tips: choose warm fabrics, layer appropriately, and opt for closed-toe footwear.</p><p><h2>Formal Winter Wedding Attire</h2></p><p>For a formal winter wedding, you'll want to dress in a long gown or a dressy suit. A floor-length velvet dress or a sequin gown would be a great choice for a winter wedding. For men, a dark suit with a tie or bowtie would be appropriate. Make sure to accessorize with statement jewelry or a scarf to add some extra warmth to your outfit.</p><p><h2>Semi-Formal Winter Wedding Attire</h2></p><p>If the dress code for a winter wedding is semi-formal, you can opt for a cocktail dress or a dressy skirt and top.
