I was amazed at how simple yet delicious the pizza tasted. When I returned home, I was determined to recreate that taste. After many attempts, I finally found the perfect recipe.</p><p>Ingredients:</p><ul><li>For the Dough:</li><li>4 cups of flour</li><li>1 and 1/2 cups of warm water</li><li>1 tablespoon of active dry yeast</li><li>1 tablespoon of salt</li><li>1 tablespoon of sugar</li><li>For the Sauce:</li><li>1 can of San Marzano tomatoes</li><li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li><li>1 teaspoon of salt</li><li>1 teaspoon of sugar</li><li>1 teaspoon of dried oregano</li><li>For the Toppings:</li><li>Fresh mozzarella cheese</li><li>Fresh basil leaves</li><li>Pepperoni</li><li>Mushrooms</li><li>Black olives</li></ul><p>Instructions:</p><ol><li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, salt, and sugar. Slowly add in the warm water and mix until a dough forms.</li><li>Knead the dough for 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover it with a towel. Let it rise for 1-2 hours until it doubles in size.</li><li>Preheat your oven to 500°F (260°C).</li><li>While the dough is rising, prepare the sauce. In a blender, blend the San Marzano tomatoes until they become a smooth sauce. Add in the olive oil, salt, sugar, and oregano and mix until well combined.</li><li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal parts. Roll out each piece of dough on a floured surface until it becomes the desired thickness.</li><li>Place the dough on a pizza stone or baking sheet. Spread the sauce over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Add your desired toppings and sprinkle with fresh basil leaves.</li><li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted.</li><li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li></ol><h3>Tips and Tricks</h3><p>For the best results, use high-quality ingredients. Look for San Marzano tomatoes for the sauce and fresh mozzarella cheese for the toppings. You can also experiment with different toppings to find your perfect combination.</p><h4>How to Store Leftover Pizza</h4><p>If you have leftover pizza, you can store it in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. To reheat, place the pizza in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 10-15 minutes or until heated through.</p><h2>Questions and Answers</h2><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I use a different type of cheese for the toppings?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can use any type of cheese that you prefer. However, for an authentic Italian taste, we recommend using fresh mozzarella cheese.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I make the dough ahead of time?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can make the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Let it come to room temperature before rolling it out and adding the toppings.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I freeze the pizza?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can freeze the pizza for up to 3 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before placing it in the freezer.
