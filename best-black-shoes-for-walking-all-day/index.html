Running shoes tend to be more supportive and cushioned, but they may not provide the same level of stability and traction that walking shoes do.</p><p><strong>Q: How do I know if my shoes fit properly?</strong></p><p>A: Proper fit is essential for comfortable walking shoes. Your shoes should fit snugly but not be too tight or too loose. Make sure there's enough room in the toe box for your toes to wiggle and that the heel is secure and doesn't slip. It's also a good idea to try on shoes at the end of the day when your feet are at their largest.</p><p><strong>Q: How often should I replace my walking shoes?</strong></p><p>A: The lifespan of walking shoes varies depending on factors such as frequency of use and the type of activities you do. As a general rule, it's a good idea to replace your walking shoes every 300-500 miles or every 6-8 months.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I wear orthotics with my walking shoes?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, many walking shoes are designed to accommodate orthotics. Look for shoes with removable insoles and ample room in the toe box. It's also a good idea to consult with a podiatrist to ensure that your orthotics are properly fitted and compatible with your shoes.</p></article>
