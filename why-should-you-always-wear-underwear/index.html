Here are some tips:</p><p>1. Wash your underwear after each use in hot water with detergent.</p><p>2. Avoid using fabric softeners or bleach, as they can damage the fabric.</p><p>3. Dry your underwear on low heat or air dry to prevent shrinkage.</p><p>4. Rotate your underwear to prevent wear and tear.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Why Should You Always Wear Underwear</h2></p><p>Wearing underwear is not just a fashion statement, it's a practical necessity.
