Polyester is a synthetic fiber that does not breathe well and can trap moisture, causing discomfort in hot weather. Nylon is a strong and lightweight fiber, but it may not be as breathable as cotton. Spandex is a stretchy fiber that can provide a comfortable fit, but it may not be as durable as cotton.Cotton Blends for Cargo PantsCotton blends can also be a good choice for cargo pants.
