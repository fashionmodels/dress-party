<meta name="description" content="11 Best Old School Skateboards Compare &amp; Save (2018)If you grew up skateboarding, you know that the brands you wear are just as important as the tricks you land. And while there are plenty of new skate brands out there, there&#39;s nothing quite like the feeling of riding a board from one of the classic, old school skate brands. In this article, we&#39;ll take a look at some of the best old school skate brands and why they still hold a special place in our hearts.Skateboarding has come a long way since it first gained popularity in the 1970s. While today&#39;s skateboarding scene is filled with new technology and tricks, there&#39;s still a certain charm to the old school skate brands that helped shape the sport into what it is today. From Vision to Santa Cruz to Powell Peralta, these brands have stood the test of time and continue to be popular among skaters of all ages.If you&#39;re looking to get into skateboarding, or are simply looking for a new board to ride, you can&#39;t go wrong with one of these classic brands. Not only are they built to last, but they also offer a sense of nostalgia that&#39;s hard to beat.In this article, we&#39;ll take a closer look at some of the best old school skate brands, including their history, their most popular products, and what makes them stand out from the rest. We&#39;ll also provide some personal insight into why we love these brands and why they&#39;re still relevant today.Vision SkateboardsWhen it comes to old school skate brands, Vision Skateboards is one of the most iconic. Founded in 1976 by Mark Gonzales, Vision quickly gained popularity among skaters for its innovative designs and high-quality boards. Some of the most popular Vision decks include the Psycho Stick and the Gator, which are still sought after by collectors today.Personally, I remember my first Vision board like it was yesterday. It was a neon green deck with the Vision logo emblazoned across the bottom. I took that board everywhere with me, from the skatepark to the streets. And while I&#39;ve since moved on to newer boards, I still have a soft spot for Vision and everything it represents.Santa Cruz SkateboardsAnother one of the best old school skate brands is Santa Cruz Skateboards. Founded in 1973 by Rich Novak and Jay Shuirman, Santa Cruz quickly became known for its distinctive graphics and high-quality boards. Some of the most popular Santa Cruz decks include the Rob Roskopp Target 2 and the Jeff Grosso Demon.Personally, I have a Santa Cruz deck hanging on my wall right now. It&#39;s a vintage deck from the early 90s with a classic Santa Cruz graphic. While I don&#39;t ride it anymore, it serves as a reminder of my early days as a skater and the sense of freedom that came with it.Powell Peralta SkateboardsFounded in 1978 by skateboarding legends Stacy Peralta and George Powell, Powell Peralta Skateboards is another one of the best old school skate brands. Known for its iconic Bones Brigade team and its innovative designs, Powell Peralta continues to be a popular choice among skaters today.Personally, I remember being obsessed with the Bones Brigade as a kid. I had posters of Tony Hawk, Steve Caballero, and Lance Mountain hanging on my wall, and I dreamed of one day being as good as they were. While I never quite made it to their level, I still have a lot of respect for Powell Peralta and everything they&#39;ve done for the sport of skateboarding.Vans Skate ShoesWhile not necessarily a skateboard brand in the traditional sense, Vans Skate Shoes has long been associated with skateboarding culture. Founded in 1966 by Paul Van Doren, Vans quickly became popular among skaters for their durable construction and sticky soles, which provided excellent grip on a skateboard.Personally, I&#39;ve been wearing Vans Skate Shoes for as long as I can remember. They&#39;re comfortable, durable, and they look great both on and off a skateboard. And while there are plenty of other skate shoe brands out there, there&#39;s something about Vans that just feels right.Question and AnswerQ: What makes old school skate brands so special?A: Old school skate brands represent a simpler time in skateboarding, before it became a mainstream sport.

And while there are plenty of new skate brands out there, there's nothing quite like the feeling of riding a board from one of the classic, old school skate brands. In this article, we'll take a look at some of the best old school skate brands and why they still hold a special place in our hearts.</p><p>Skateboarding has come a long way since it first gained popularity in the 1970s. While today's skateboarding scene is filled with new technology and tricks, there's still a certain charm to the old school skate brands that helped shape the sport into what it is today. From Vision to Santa Cruz to Powell Peralta, these brands have stood the test of time and continue to be popular among skaters of all ages.</p><p>If you're looking to get into skateboarding, or are simply looking for a new board to ride, you can't go wrong with one of these classic brands. Not only are they built to last, but they also offer a sense of nostalgia that's hard to beat.</p><p>In this article, we'll take a closer look at some of the best old school skate brands, including their history, their most popular products, and what makes them stand out from the rest. We'll also provide some personal insight into why we love these brands and why they're still relevant today.</p><p><h2>Vision Skateboards</h2></p><p>When it comes to old school skate brands, Vision Skateboards is one of the most iconic. Founded in 1976 by Mark Gonzales, Vision quickly gained popularity among skaters for its innovative designs and high-quality boards. Some of the most popular Vision decks include the Psycho Stick and the Gator, which are still sought after by collectors today.</p><p>Personally, I remember my first Vision board like it was yesterday. It was a neon green deck with the Vision logo emblazoned across the bottom. I took that board everywhere with me, from the skatepark to the streets. And while I've since moved on to newer boards, I still have a soft spot for Vision and everything it represents.</p><p><h2>Santa Cruz Skateboards</h2></p><p>Another one of the best old school skate brands is Santa Cruz Skateboards. Founded in 1973 by Rich Novak and Jay Shuirman, Santa Cruz quickly became known for its distinctive graphics and high-quality boards. Some of the most popular Santa Cruz decks include the Rob Roskopp Target 2 and the Jeff Grosso Demon.</p><p>Personally, I have a Santa Cruz deck hanging on my wall right now. It's a vintage deck from the early 90s with a classic Santa Cruz graphic. While I don't ride it anymore, it serves as a reminder of my early days as a skater and the sense of freedom that came with it.</p><p><h3>Powell Peralta Skateboards</h3></p><p>Founded in 1978 by skateboarding legends Stacy Peralta and George Powell, Powell Peralta Skateboards is another one of the best old school skate brands. Known for its iconic Bones Brigade team and its innovative designs, Powell Peralta continues to be a popular choice among skaters today.</p><p>Personally, I remember being obsessed with the Bones Brigade as a kid. I had posters of Tony Hawk, Steve Caballero, and Lance Mountain hanging on my wall, and I dreamed of one day being as good as they were. While I never quite made it to their level, I still have a lot of respect for Powell Peralta and everything they've done for the sport of skateboarding.</p><p><h4>Vans Skate Shoes</h4></p><p>While not necessarily a skateboard brand in the traditional sense, Vans Skate Shoes has long been associated with skateboarding culture. Founded in 1966 by Paul Van Doren, Vans quickly became popular among skaters for their durable construction and sticky soles, which provided excellent grip on a skateboard.</p><p>Personally, I've been wearing Vans Skate Shoes for as long as I can remember. They're comfortable, durable, and they look great both on and off a skateboard. And while there are plenty of other skate shoe brands out there, there's something about Vans that just feels right.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q: What makes old school skate brands so special?</strong></p><p>A: Old school skate brands represent a simpler time in skateboarding, before it became a mainstream sport. They're also associated with some of the most iconic skateboarders of all time, from Tony Hawk to Steve Caballero to Mark Gonzales.</p><p><strong>Q: Are old school skate brands still relevant today?</strong></p><p>A: Absolutely! While there are plenty of new skate brands out there, old school skate brands continue to be popular among skaters of all ages. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, you can't go wrong with a board from one of these classic brands.</p><p><strong>Q: What should I look for when buying an old school skateboard?</strong></p><p>A: When buying an old school skateboard, it's important to look for a board that's both durable and high-quality. You'll also want to pay attention to the graphics and design, as these are often what make old school skateboards so special.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I still find old school skateboards for sale?</strong></p><p>A: While some old school skateboards are hard to come by, you can still find them for sale online or in specialty skate shops. Just be prepared to pay a premium for some of the rarer decks!</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Best Old School Skate Brands</h2></p><p>Whether you're a longtime skater or just starting out, there's something special about riding a board from one of the best old school skate brands.
