It spawned several sequels, all of which were successful in their own right.

The image of Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art is instantly recognizable and has been parodied in countless movies and TV shows.</p><p><h3>The Soundtrack of Rocky</h3></p><p>One of the most memorable aspects of Rocky is its soundtrack. The movie's main theme, "Gonna Fly Now," has become synonymous with the underdog story. The soundtrack also features other memorable songs such as "Eye of the Tiger" and "Living in America."</p><p><h4>How to Watch Rocky</h4></p><p>If you haven't seen Rocky yet, you're in luck.
