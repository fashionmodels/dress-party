Ultimately, the best suits strike a balance between form and function.</p><p>So, what makes an Iron Man suit great?

It's a heavily-armed suit that's designed to take on enemies that are too powerful for regular humans to handle. This suit has been through many iterations over the years, but it's always been a fan favorite.</p><h2>The Extremis Armor</h2><p>The Extremis Armor is a suit that Tony built using the Extremis virus, which allows him to control the suit with his mind.
