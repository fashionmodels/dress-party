We will be providing readers with an insight into the biggest fights, the amount of money generated, and the reasons behind their success.</p><p><h2>The Fight of the Century: Mayweather vs. Pacquiao</h2></p><p>One of the most anticipated boxing matches of all time was the fight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao. The fight took place on May 2, 2015, and was dubbed "The Fight of the Century." The fight generated a whopping $600 million in revenue, making it the highest earning boxing match in history.</p><p>As a boxing fan, I remember eagerly waiting for this fight to happen. The buildup to the fight was intense, with both fighters trash-talking each other in the media. The fight itself was a disappointment, with Mayweather winning by unanimous decision. However, it was still a massive financial success.</p><p><h2>Mayweather vs. McGregor: The Money Fight</h2></p><p>In 2017, Floyd Mayweather Jr. returned to the ring to face Conor McGregor in what was dubbed "The Money Fight."

They receive a guaranteed purse, which is a set amount of money that they will earn regardless of the outcome of the fight. They also receive a percentage of the pay-per-view revenue, which can be a significant amount of money.</p><p>In addition to this, boxers can also earn money through sponsorships, endorsements, and appearance fees. The highest earning boxers in the world are not just great fighters, but they are also savvy businessmen who know how to make money both inside and outside the ring.</p><p><h2>The Battle of the Titans: Tyson vs. Holyfield II</h2></p><p>The fight between Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield II was one of the most memorable boxing matches of all time. The fight generated $100 million in revenue, making it one of the highest earning boxing matches in history.</p><p>I remember watching this fight as a child and being amazed by the skill of both fighters.
