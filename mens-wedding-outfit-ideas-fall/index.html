Whether you&#39;re attending a formal black-tie affair or a more laid-back outdoor ceremony, we&#39;ve got you covered. Formal Black-Tie WeddingFor a formal black-tie wedding, you&#39;ll need to dress to impress. A classic black tuxedo is always a safe bet, but if you want to mix it up a bit, consider a deep navy or charcoal suit.

Semi-Formal WeddingFor a semi-formal wedding, you can opt for a suit in a lighter color, such as beige or light gray. Pair your suit with a dress shirt in a complementary color, and add a tie or bowtie to complete the look. You can also wear a blazer with dress pants for a more relaxed yet polished look. Outdoor WeddingIf you&#39;re attending an outdoor wedding, you&#39;ll want to dress for comfort and practicality. Opt for lightweight fabrics, such as linen or cotton, and choose a suit or blazer in a lighter color. You can skip the tie and wear a dress shirt with the top button undone for a more relaxed look. Loafers or dressy sandals are a great choice for footwear, and don&#39;t forget a pair of sunglasses to protect your eyes from the sun. Casual WeddingFor a casual wedding, you can dress down a bit while still looking stylish. Consider wearing a blazer or sport coat with jeans or chinos. You can skip the tie and wear a dress shirt with the top button undone for a more relaxed look. Loafers or dressy sneakers are a great choice for footwear.
