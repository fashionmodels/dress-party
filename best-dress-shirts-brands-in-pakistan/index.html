First and foremost, pay attention to the fit. Pakistani dress shirts tend to be more fitted than their Western counterparts, so be sure to try on a few different sizes to find the perfect fit. Additionally, look for shirts made from high-quality fabrics like Egyptian cotton, which will hold up well over time and feel soft against the skin.</p><p><h4>How to Care for Pakistani Dress Shirts</h4></p><p>To ensure that your Pakistani dress shirts last as long as possible, it's important to take proper care of them.
