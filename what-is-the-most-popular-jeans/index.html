Additionally, think about the style you want. Do you want a classic straight-leg jean or a trendy mom jean? Lastly, consider the wash of the denim.

One of these is Wrangler. Wrangler is known for their durable, high-quality denim and offer a range of styles and fits. Another brand to consider is Madewell.
