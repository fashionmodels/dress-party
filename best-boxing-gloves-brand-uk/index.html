As a general rule, most people choose gloves that are between 12 and 16 ounces.</p><p><strong>Q: How do I know if my gloves fit properly?</strong></p><p>A: Your gloves should fit snugly, but not be too tight. You should be able to make a fist comfortably, without any excess material around your fingers. If you're unsure about the fit of your gloves, try them on and make a few punches to see how they feel.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use the same gloves for sparring and bag work?</strong></p><p>A: It's generally not recommended to use the same gloves for sparring and bag work.
