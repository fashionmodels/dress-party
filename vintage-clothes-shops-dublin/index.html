The shop is owned and operated by Lucy, a vintage enthusiast with a passion for all things retro. Her shop is filled with a wide variety of vintage clothing, from 1920s flapper dresses to 1980s power suits.</p><p>I remember the first time I walked into Lucy's Lounge. The shop was bursting with color and energy, and I was immediately drawn to a rack of 1960s shift dresses. I ended up purchasing a gorgeous yellow and green dress that I still wear to this day. I love that each piece in the shop has a story to tell, and that I can be a part of that story by wearing it.</p><p><h2>Vintage Clothes Shops in Dublin: Om Diva</h2></p><p>Om Diva is a vintage shop and creative space located in the trendy area of Drury Street.
