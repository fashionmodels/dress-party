Ajio also has a section for sustainable and eco-friendly fashion, if that's something you're interested in.</p><h3>3. Shein</h3><p>Shein is a Chinese e-commerce platform that has become very popular in India in recent years. They offer a huge selection of trendy clothes at very low prices.

Here are some tips for shopping safely:</p><h4>1. Do your research</h4><p>Before making a purchase from a new website or app, do some research to make sure it's legitimate.

Be wary of websites that promise designer clothes at very low prices.</p><h4>3. Check the return policy</h4><p>Make sure you understand the return policy before making a purchase. If the website doesn't have a clear return policy, it's best to avoid it.</p><h4>4. Use secure payment methods</h4><p>When making a purchase online, always use a secure payment method like a credit card or PayPal. Avoid websites that ask you to enter your bank account details or other sensitive information.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><h3>1.
