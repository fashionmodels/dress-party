The sweetness of the peppers complements the saltiness of the meats and cheese perfectly.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><b>Q: Can I add mayo to my traditional Italian sub?</b></p><p>A: While mayo is not a typical ingredient in a traditional Italian sub, you can certainly add it if you prefer it.</p><p><b>Q: Can I order a traditional Italian sub without any vegetables?</b></p><p>A: Yes, you can customize your sandwich to your preferences, but keep in mind that the vegetables add a refreshing crunch to the sandwich.</p><p><b>Q: Is a traditional Italian sub typically served hot or cold?</b></p><p>A: A traditional Italian sub is typically served cold, but some variations include hot ingredients such as meatballs or sausage.</p><p><b>Q: What type of bread is typically used for a traditional Italian sub?</b></p><p>A: A long roll or baguette is the typical bread used for a traditional Italian sub.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of What Comes on a Traditional Italian Sub</h2></p><p>The traditional Italian sub is a classic sandwich that is loved by many for its combination of deli meats, cheese, and vegetables. While it comes with a standard set of ingredients, it can be customized to your liking. Don't be afraid to try new variations and add your own twist to this beloved sandwich.</p></article>
